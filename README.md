### Description

I looked high, I looked low. But I couldn't find an example anywhere like this. Inet Who Is IP address lookup directly thru, yes the main database. "whois.arin.net" In 12 lines of code using a single function. No more having to go thru a middleman for simple Who Is lookups. After writing Who Is I decided to see if I could pull off NTP also. What do you know, I did ! LOL I hope this simple code is as big to you as it is to me ! If it is please vote. Enjoy !!!
